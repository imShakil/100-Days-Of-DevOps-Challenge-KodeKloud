# Create IAM Policy Using Terraform

When establishing infrastructure on the AWS cloud, Identity and Access Management (IAM) is among the first and most critical services to configure. IAM facilitates the creation and management of user accounts, groups, roles, policies, and other access controls. The Nautilus DevOps team is currently in the process of configuring these resources and has outlined the following requirements.

Create an IAM policy named `iampolicy_ravi` in `us-east-1` region using Terraform. It must allow read-only access to the `EC2 console`, i.e., this policy must allow users to view `all instances`, `AMIs`, and `snapshots` in the Amazon EC2 console.

The Terraform working directory is `/home/bob/terraform`. Create the `main.tf` file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.

> Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

## Steps

1. Create a `main.tf` file with the following contents:

    ```hcl
    resource "aws_iam_policy" "policy" {
        name        = var.policy_name
        path        = "/"
        description = "My test policy"

        policy = jsonencode({
            Version = "2012-10-17"
            Statement = [
            {
                Action = [
                "ec2:Describe*",
                ]
                Effect   = "Allow"
                Resource = "*"
            },
            ]
        })

        tags = {
            Name = var.policy_name
        }

    }
    ```

2. Let's define the variable by creating a `variables.tf` file:

    ```hcl
    variable "policy_name" {
        default = "iampolicy_ravi" 
    }
    ```

    > Make sure you have changed the value here according to your task description

3. Run the terraform commands:

    ```sh
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

## Good To Know

- **IAM Policy Structure**: Uses JSON format with Version, Statement, Effect, Action, and Resource
- **ec2:Describe*** wildcard covers all EC2 read operations (instances, AMIs, snapshots, volumes, etc.)
- **Resource "*"** grants access to all EC2 resources across all regions
- **Effect "Allow"** explicitly permits the specified actions
- **Policy Attachment**: This policy needs to be attached to users, groups, or roles to take effect
- **Least Privilege**: Read-only access follows security best practice of minimal permissions
