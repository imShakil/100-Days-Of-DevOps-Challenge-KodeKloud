# Create EC2 Instance Using Terraform

The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units.

For this task, create an EC2 instance using Terraform with the following requirements:

1. The name of the instance must be `xfusion-ec2`.

2. Use the Amazon Linux `ami-0c101f26f147fa7fd` to launch this instance.

3. The Instance type must be `t2.micro`.

4. Create a new RSA key named `xfusion-kp`.

5. Attach the default (available by default) security group.

The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to provision the instance.

> Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

## Steps

1. Let's create the `main.tf` file copy paste the contents from this [terraform file](../files/terraform_create_aws_ec2_instance-96.tf). In our main.tf file, we have used some resource block to generate ssh key, create key pair in aws and launch ec2 instance. 

    - `tls_private_key` resource block to generate an RSA private key
    - `aws_key_pair` resource block to create key pair at aws cloud.
    - `aws_instance` to launch the ec2 instance

2. For this main.tf file, we need some variables. Let's create `variables.tf` and add following variables:

    ```hcl
    variable "prefix" {
        default = "xfusion"
    }

    variable "ami_id" {
        default = "ami-0c101f26f147fa7fd"
    }

    variable "instance_type" {
        default = "t2.micro"
    }
    ```

    > Make sure you have updated `prefix` default value according to your task.

3. This is optional. You can create a `outputs.tf` file to display the ec2 instance information. 

    ```hcl
    output "ec2_info" {
        value = {
            public_ip = aws_instance.ec2.public_ip
            private_ip = aws_instance.ec2.private_ip
        }
    }
    ```

4. Let's run the terraform commands:

    ```sh
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

## Good To Know

- **Default Security Group**: AWS automatically attaches the default VPC security group when no specific security group is specified
- **Key Pair Management**: The `tls_private_key` resource generates the private key locally, while `aws_key_pair` uploads the public key to AWS
- **AMI Selection**: Always verify AMI availability in your target AWS region before deployment
- **Instance State**: EC2 instances start in 'pending' state and transition to 'running' once fully initialized
- **Cost Optimization**: Remember to destroy resources after testing to avoid unnecessary charges
- **Terraform State**: The `.tfstate` file tracks resource mappings - keep it secure and backed up
